- Tested on Firefox v26 and Chrome v32
- Uses Twitter Bootstrap as framework
- Javascript form validation (name, email, phone, city, country, display name)
- Javascript for populating city drop-down list when choosing country (placeholders at the moment - shouldn't country be before city?)
- Modal popups for list elements in the right box
- Page responsive
- Working carousel
- SEO friendly? (alt tags?)
- Twitter placeholders (I assume the page requires Twitter integration)
- Newsletter form validation (requires checked checkbox and valid email)
